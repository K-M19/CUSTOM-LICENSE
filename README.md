# Custom Software License â€“ Created by K-M19 (ButAa)

Copyright (c) 2025 K-M19 (ButAa)

Permission is granted to any user who becomes the owner of a copy of this software and documentation files (the "Software") to utilize the Software on the following terms and conditions:

**1. Free of Charge**
All software and projects written or published by the author are made available entirely for free. No payment, subscription, or license fee is required to use or distribute the Software under this license.

**2. Non-Commercial Use Only**
The Software is made available solely as free software.
Selling, reselling, bundling, or trading the Software in any form whatsoever is strictly prohibited.
Use of the Software in any commercial activitiesâ€”including but not limited to its inclusion in paid packages, subscription services, or commercial environmentsâ€”is prohibited.
The Software is intended for use only for non-commercial, personal, or educational purposes.
Violation of this provision is a breach of license.

**3. Prohibition of Malicious Use**
The Software will not be used for any illegal, unethical, or harmful purposes. These include, but are not limited to: scams, fraud, exploitation, unauthorized usage, or abuse of extended features to carry out intrusive or harmful activities.

**4. Implied License Agreement**
By downloading, installing, using, or redistributing the Software, you agree that you have read, understood, and accepted the terms of this license as a whole. No explicit signature or acknowledgment is required; use alone is agreement.

**5. Closed Source Requirement**
The source code of the Software or any derivative projects may or may not be made public, solely at the author's discretion.
Neither individuals nor organizations have the right to request release of, or access to, the source code for the Software by any means.
Whether or not to publish or release the source code is entirely up to the author.

**6. Disclaimer of Liability**
The Software is provided "as is," with no warranty of any kind. The author is not responsible for damages, loss of data, malfunction, or liability resulting from the use or misuse of the Software.

**7. Attribution Misrepresentation**
You may not resell or redistribute the Software, passing it off as your own work. Any misrepresentation of the authorship is punishable by law.

**8. Update and Support Policy**
Some projects have support, update, or warranty durations. They may be extended, delayed, or cancelled at any time without notice. There is no promise that the author will keep on providing updates or support.

**9. DRM Notice â€“ Bitraven Protection**
Software authored or initiated by the author may be secured by DRM technology called Bitraven. The system prevents reverse-engineering, examination, or tampering with executable files (.exe,.btrv,.btrv2, scripts).
Due to this security layer, antivirus software (including Microsoft Defender) may falsely identify the Software as malware. This is a natural behavior and not indicative of actual threat.
Bitraven aims at anti-analysis and integrity protection, which may conflict with standard antivirus heuristics.
Efforts to certify Bitraven through third-party vendors were denied on grounds of overly high fees and demands for source code revelation, which the author resisted to keep proprietary security. 

**10. Changes to License Without Notice**
The author can modify, amend, or add clauses to this license at any moment without notice. Users should refer to the latest license version. Continued use is construed as agreement to updates.

**11. Software Safety & International Standards Compliance**
The author warrants that the Software is virus-free or contains no malicious code, intentionally.
It is composed in best safe programming practice with commitment to user protection, data integrity, and overall adherence to international software safety standards.
Some false positives still may occur due to the nature of DRM protection (see clause 9).

**12. User Privacy & Data Security Commitment**
This Software is very much focused on user privacy. It does not transfer or access sensitive data such as:

- Passwords
- Cookies
- Browser history
- Keystrokes
- Personal files or system logs

The Software contains no Remote Access Trojan (RAT) or other malicious material.
User data is all local except where stated otherwise.

**13. Disclaimer of Responsibility for Software Conflicts and System Errors**
The author is not responsible for:

- Incompatibility with other software
- Driver or operating system errors
- Malfunctions or crashes in hardware

Use at user's own risk.

**14. Disclaimer of Service Availability & Uptime**
Should the Software use remote servers or an internet connection, no warranty is made about uptime or continuity of service. Interruptions or downtime may occur, and the author is not to be held liable.

**15. Legal Use Disclaimer**
The Software shall not be used for illicit purposes. Users are responsible for obeying relevant legislation. The author is exempted from legal consequences for misuse.

**16. VirusTotal and Antivirus Detection Description**
Users can notice that uploading this Software to VirusTotal or similar antivirus software triggers false positive notifications (e.g., Trojan detection).
This is due to the fact that Bitraven DRM has been applied, which includes:

- Anti-debug features
- Code obfuscation
- Anti-disassembly techniques

They are needed to prevent against reverse engineering and illegal scrutiny.
Unfortunately, these techniques act like malicious behavior to malware-like engines within the view of heuristic-based antivirus programs.
Such messages are expected to occur and do not necessarily point toward actual safety within the Software.

**17. Privacy Clause Tamper Protection**
Even if such a license is modified, any term regarding user privacy, security, or data protection (including clause 13) shall remain in full effect and shall not be deleted, ignored, or rewritten under any condition.

**18. License Expiration and Update Responsibility**
This license document may become outdated if it is incorporated into or downloaded with the software. The author reserves the right to amend, revise, or replace this license at any time.

The users are wholly responsible for ensuring they are working with the most current version of the license. The most recent version is constantly available at:

If a user uses an older version of the license obtained through download or packaging, they are still bound by the updated terms posted on the aforementioned official pages.

Also, should this software be redistributed, repacked, or included in other distributions, either include this whole license text or include a hyperlink directly to official license URLs presented above. Failing this would be a licensing breach.
